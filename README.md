touch-pch
=========

Touch your .pch files recursively.

##Brief

There is something fishy going on with Xcode6 and precompiled headers...
Sometimes the build fails and you have to touch your .pch files to fix it, 
this script makes life a bit easier. 

##Usage 

ruby touch-pch.rb [XCODE_PROJECT_DIR]
